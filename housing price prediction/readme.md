Housing Price Prediction using Linear Regression

Objective  
In this project, I implemented Linear Regression after learning the concept in theory.  
The goal was to understand how linear regression works in practice using a real dataset.

About the Project  
I used the California Housing dataset to predict house prices.  
This project helped me connect mathematical concepts of linear regression with actual code implementation.

Steps I Performed  

1. Loaded and explored the dataset  
2. Checked for missing values  
3. Replaced missing values in total_bedrooms using median  
4. Performed basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Applied One-Hot Encoding to the categorical feature (ocean_proximity)  
6. Split the dataset into training and testing sets  
7. Applied feature scaling using StandardScaler  
8. Trained a Linear Regression model  
9. Evaluated the model using R² score  

Model Result  

R² Score: ~0.62  

What I Learned  

- How Linear Regression works in practice  
- How to preprocess real-world datasets  
- Importance of handling missing values  
- How to encode categorical variables  
- Why feature scaling matters  
- How to evaluate regression models  

Tools Used  

- Python
